CleanerML Repository
====================

This repository is an experiment whether GitHub provides an efficent platform for a community to develop safe and effective system cleaners.  If the experiment is successful, BleachBit will provide automated access to this repository to support a wide variety of applications.


CleanerML
---------
CleanerML is a simple yet powerful markup language for writing cleaners. Most of BleachBit's cleaners are written in CleanerML, and you can write your own cleaners in CleanerML too.

You can think of it as writing XML to delete files, but it is more powerful than that. 



BleachBit
---------
BleachBit is an open source system cleaner for Windows and Linux.
